# C-exCeptions

Macros for throwing and handling exceptions in C, in a ``try``/``catch``/``finally``-like fashion.
I tried my best to reproduce C# exception handling syntax, but it cannot be perfect due to the limitations of macros.

## How to use

See the [example](https://github.com/5cover/C-exCeptions/blob/main/example/main.c).

## Contributing

I'm not a very experienced C programmer. There's probably a million ways to break this. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.
